===========

A set of uh... libraries? I don't know, files that can be
included, those are libraries, right? Whatever you want to
call these, I don't care.

I initially made these for some guys who wanted to make a
game in C, in the command line, but weren's really comfortable
with the language. I'm not experienced at all, but I like C.

So I quickly pulled something off similar to this and gave it
to them. It worked and they're making their little game. This
has nothing like a game engine and its only purpose is to
create command-line displays and do some other "graphical"
things with it.

I decided to rewrite it and this is my attempt at doing so. I
actually need to work on a Java thing for school, but I didn't
feel inclined to use that language this week, so... fuck.

K bye.
