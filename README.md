A library for making 2D displays in the command line. Yay!

I initially made these for some guys who wanted to make a
game in C, in the command line, but weren't really comfortable
with the language. I'm not experienced at all, but I like C.

So I quickly pulled something off similar to this and gave it
to them. It worked and they're making their little game. This
has nothing like a game engine and its only purpose is to
create command-line displays and do some other "graphical"
things with it.

I decided to rewrite it yet again and this is my attempt at doing
so.
