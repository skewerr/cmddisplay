# fill

This will just draw a triangle, hang for 2 seconds, fill it and then
display it onscreen. It was for testing purposes, at the time I made
it, I put a call for `usleep` and `display_show` in `fill_boundary_fill`
so that I'd see it in action. Now it's just here as a placeholder for
when I make more functions for `cmdfill` and implement them.

**Update:** It now also clears the screen and draws two circumferences.
