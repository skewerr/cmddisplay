snake
=====

Just a clone of the snake game I'm making as a demo
to cmddisplay. I put the header files in `include`
and compiled libraries in `lib`. `libqueue` is just
something I made for my data structures class. I'll
put the source up somewhere else.

So I tried, but I can't make this on Linux just yet.
Sorry, I'm too dumb to do it. I'll have other demos
that'll work cross-platform, though.

`f` is where I'll put "sprite" files.

To compile:

`cc -o snake snake.c -Llib -Iinclude -lqueue -lcmddisplay`

TODO: most stuff.
