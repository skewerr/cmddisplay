snake
=====

Just a clone of the snake game I'm making as a demo
to cmddisplay. I put the header files in `include`
and compiled libraries in `lib`. `libqueue` is just
something I made for my data structures class. I'll
put the source up somewhere else.

`f` is where I'll put "sprite" files.

To compile:
`cc -o snake snake.c -Llib -Iinclude -lqueue -lcmddisplay`

TODO: most stuff.
